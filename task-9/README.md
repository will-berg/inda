### Deadline
This work should be completed before **Friday 15th November**.

### Instructions
For instructions on how to do and submit the assignment, please see the
[assignments section of the course instructions](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-19/course-instructions#assignments).

### Homework
Study the sections outlined below and be prepared to discuss the contents.

* **5th ed:** All of chapter 7.
* **6th ed:** All of chapter 9.

Additionally, if you are not using BlueJ, the following material may prove
useful for running the JUnit4 test classes in this assignment.

* [Running JUnit4 from the command line](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-19/course-instructions/blob/master/junit4_12_command_line.md)
* [Using IntelliJ with JUnit4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU0Ittkjx4Y)
    - **Note:** Eclipse also has excellent support for JUnit4, but we
      unfortunately have not had the time to make a video tutorial of that.

> **Important:** We use **JUnit 4.12** in the INDA courses. Using later or
> earlier versions of JUnit most likely will not work with our test
> classes.

> **Important:** It can often be a bit difficult to get up and running with
> JUnit4. Make sure that you have tried to run the test class in the [Sieve
> exercises](#the-sieve-of-eratosthenes) as early as possible, and if you can't
> get it to work _do visit the lab session_.

### Github Task:
Complete the following exercises. Exercise numbers in parentheses
are for the 6th ed, while the ones without are for the 5th ed.

- 7.13 (9.13)
- 7.15 (9.15)
- 7.16 (9.16)
- 7.18 (Not availabe in 6th ed)

After doing these exercises, proceed to the last section in which you will
test and extend an algorithm for checking primes!

Please commit any Java code developed to the src folder of your KTH Github
repo. Remember to push to KTH Github.

### Testing Online Shop

#### Exercise 7.13 (9.13)
Create a test class for the `Comment` class in the online-shop-junit project.

#### Exercise 7.15 (9.15)
Create a test to check that `addComment` returns false when a comment from the
same author already exists.

#### Exercise 7.16 (9.16)
Create a test that performs negative testing on the boundaries of the `rating`
range. That is, test the values 0 and 6 as a rating (the values just outside
the legal range). We expect these to return false, so assert false in the
result dialog. You will notice that one of these actually (incorrectly) returns
true. This is the bug we uncovered earlier in manual testing. Make sure that
you assert false anyway. The assertion states the expected result, not the
actual result.

#### Exercise 7.18 (Not available in 6th ed)
Create a test that checks whether the author and rating details are stored
correctly after creation. Record separate tests that check whether the `upvote`
and `downvote` methods work as expected.

### The Sieve of Eratosthenes
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is divisible only by
itself and 1. The
[Sieve of Eratosthenes (Wikipedia link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)
is a classic algorithm for finding out which numbers are prime, and which are
not. It does so by first assuming that all numbers are prime, and then,
starting from 2 (the first prime), marking all _multiples_ (i.e. 4, 6, 8, 10
etc) as _not_ prime. Obviously, a multiple of a prime is not a prime. Then it
finds the next prime (in this case, 3), and does the same thing, and then for
5, 7 and so on. The animation below is taken from the Wikipedia entry, and
visually illustrates this process:

In this exercise, you will be given a working but not quite bulletproof
implementation of the Sieve algorithm. Your task is to test it, fix the bugs,
refactor it, and finally make an optimization. The concepts demonstrated in
this exercise are the following:

1. How to learn about code by writing tests for it.
2. How a test suite makes refactoring less error prone.
3. How to do some rudimentary Test Driven Development (TDD), that is to say,
implementing tests first and production code later.
4. What to test.
5. How to name tests. There are many patterns one can follow, but here we have
chosen to go with _someResultWhenSomething_.

The implemented algorithm looks like this:
```java
public boolean isPrime(int number) {
    boolean[] prime = new boolean[number + 1]; // + 1 because of 0-indexing
    Arrays.fill(prime, true); // assume all numbers are prime
    int sqrt = (int) Math.floor(Math.sqrt(number));
    for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt; i++) {
        if (prime[i]) {
            for (int j = i*2; j < prime.length; j+=i) {
                prime[j] = false; // mark multiples of i as not prime
            }
        }
    }
    return prime[number];
}
```
and is available at [src/Siece.java](src/Sieve.java). Take some time to
go over the lines of code, look at the Wikipedia animation and the description
and try to get a rough idea of how it works. A **JUnit4** test class with a few
tests has also been provided at [src/SieveTest.java](src/SieveTest.java), and
the type of each test (e.g. negative, positive, boundary) is noted. When you
have had a chance to look everything over, proceed with the exercises.

#### Exercise S.1
There are only positive tests in the test class. But what happens if we pass
values that are not even reasonable to consider for prime status? Implement two
tests, `isPrimeExceptionWhenNumberIsOne` (_negative border test_) and
`isPrimeExceptionWhenNumberIsMinusTen` (_negative test_), that assert that `isPrime`
throws an `IllegalArgumentException` when passed `1` and `-10` respectively. A very
neat way of asserting an exception is like this:

```java
@Test(expected=IllegalArgumentException.class)
public void isPrimeExceptionWhenNumberIsOne {
    // test code
}
```
An important thing to note here is that using this syntax to assert an
exception is only appropriate if your test consists of a single act (i.e. one
call to the method under test), and maybe some trivial arrangement that cannot
possibly throw an exception. If there is complex arrangment and several acts,
the expected exception may be thrown in the _wrong_ place, so the test passes
even though it didn't do what you wanted it to. In the case where the test is
more complex, it is more appropriate to use a _try/catch_ like this:

```java
@Test
public void moreComplexTestInWhichWeExpectAnException() {
    // possible arrangement code
    try {
        // The following method call should result in an exception
        someObject.someMethod();
        // if no exception is thrown, we fall through to this fail
        fail("Expected some exception!");
    } catch (SomeException e) {
        // Exception thrown, all good!
    }
    // possible assert code
}
```

These tests should only contain a single act, though, so the simplified syntax
of the first example may be used without worry. Note that both tests are
expected to _fail_. Also note that throwing an exception instead of returning
`false` is a design decision, and depending on the situation, it may make more
sense to do one or the other. Here, it is mostly used to demonstrate how to
assert exceptions.

#### Exercise S.2
If you did `S.1` correctly, you will notice that `isPrime` does not throw at
all when passed `1` (in fact, it thinks that `1` is prime, can you figure out
why?), and throws the wrong exception when passed `-10`. Modify the
implementation of `isPrime` so that it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`
when passed a value less than 2! Make sure to pass along an appropriate error
message as well, so the user knows what went wrong.

> **Assistant's note:** Don't remember how to throw exceptions? Have a look at
> [How to throw exceptions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/throwing.html)!

#### Exercise S.3
The Sieve algorithm has one major weakness: it cannot handle large primes as it
is dependent on an array the size of the prime being checked. There are several
optimizations that can be implemented to combat this problem, but we will
simply set a hard limit of `2^26` (`2^30` should be safe on most systems and
JVMs, but the unit tests would then run for a few seconds more than is
optimal). Implement the following three tests:

* `isPrimeFalseWhenNumberIs2Pow26`: Should assert that `isPrime` returns
  `false` when passed `2^26` (because it is not a prime).  This is a _positive
  boundary_ test.
* `isPrimeExceptionWhenNumberIs2Pow26Plus1`: Should assert that an
  `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown when the value `2^26+1` is passed to
  `isPrime`. This is a _negative boundary_ test.
* `isPrimeExceptionWhenNumberIs2Pow28`: Should assert that `isPrime` throws an
  `IllegalArgumentException` when passed values `2^28`. This is just to see
  that nothing goes wrong after the boundary. This is a _negative_ test.

> **Assistant's note:** To calculate the maximum value, as well as the test
> values, you may use `Math.pow` and cast the result to `int`. It is
> appropriate to have the maximum allowed value as a `private static final`
> field instead of recalculating it on each method call.

#### Exercise S.4
`isPrime` is doing a lot right now and is starting to get fairly bloated, so it
should be refactored. There are two major and largely unrelated tasks that can
be identified:

1. Error-handling on the input (all of your exception-throwing)
2. Calculating the `prime` array.

Write two new helper methods to handle these tasks, with the following headers:

* `private void exceptionIfIllegalArg(int)`: Should run all of the error
  handling on `number` and throw your exceptions as per usual.
* `private boolean[] sieve(int)`: Should return the `prime` array.

`isPrime` should then look like this:

```java
public boolean isPrime(int number) {
    exceptionIfIllegalArg(number);
    boolean[] prime = sieve(number);
    return prime[number];
}
```

#### Exercise S.5
For this final _coding_ exercise, you will make a major optimization for when
multiple values are checked: you will _cache_ the `prime` array. To do this,
you need to add `primeCache` as a field to `Sieve`, and initialize it as an
empty array (whether you do it in a constructor or in-line is up to you). When
`isPrime(number)` is called, you need to check if `number >= primeCache.length`
(but first do the error checking as usual!). If it is, then the number is _not_
an index of the `primeCache`, and you need to calculate a new array of
appropriate size. If `number < primeCache.length`, you may simply return
`primeChache[number]`. Run your test suite to ensure that the optimization did
not break anything (and fix the breakage if it did!).

#### Exercise S.6
Come up with one or more further optimizations that could be made to the
algorithm. Also consider if you would have to alter any of the unit tests
before implementing the optimization(s). Write down your ideas in
[docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

Of course, if you want to implement your ideas you are free to do so as long as
your implementation still passes the tests.

> **Assistant's note:** There are several optimizations that can be made to the
> array and how it is cached. Prime numbers also exhibit some recurring
> patterns that may be exploited to check fewer numbers.

### Grading Criteria
Each week we will communicate grading criteria through the [issue
tracker](../../issues/). Grading criteria set the basic standards for a pass,
komp or fail, so it is essential you review them each week. These will change
over time as your skills develop, so make sure you read the grading criteria
issue carefully and tick off all the requirements.
