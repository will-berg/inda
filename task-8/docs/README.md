### Theme
You have died and must navigate your way through a spooky church to reach heaven. 
### How to win/lose
You win by reaching heaven. You lose by walking the wrong way and ending up in hell. You can also lose if you don't get to heaven in time. 
### Extension
I added a trapdoor that can be found between heaven and hell. I also added a counter that makes it so that the maximum number of moves you can make is 4.
