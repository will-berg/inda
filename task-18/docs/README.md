**Task 3:**
Time was measured in nanoseconds but has been converted to milliseconds for table representation. 

| Size (n)   | MatrixGraph | HashGraph |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------- |
| 100        |   8.0137    |   10.0033 |
| 400        |   9.576     |   14.1959 |
| 1600       |   16.3114   |   12.5455 |
| 6400       |   50.8002   |   18.3063 |

Hash graph is faster for bigger n's since the time complexity of matrix graph is more akin to O(n^2) where as hash graph is O(n).
